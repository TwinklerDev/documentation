# Main Screen

Lets look at the main screen to see where the major functions are located.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/_media/overview.png" /></div>

The **menu bar** is the strip at the top of the screen. The main functions of Twinkler are called from the menu bar.

The **map** or **antenna** display occupies the main section in the centre of the screen, depending upon what display mode has been selected.

**map menus** are on the left side of the screen. They appear when a site or coverage is selected on the map or may be opened manually from the *view* item in the menu bar or by clicking the toggle button on the far left of the menu bar. The menus give access and control to the details of an individual project, site or coverage.

The **status bar** is the strip at the bottom of the screen. It provides updates and warnings about what actions have been performed by Twinkler. The name of the current project is shown in the left side of the status bar.

The **settings menu** appears on the far right of the menu bar. It provides options for changing the user and organisation settings as well as feedback and help.
