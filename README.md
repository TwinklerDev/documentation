# Twinkler Documentation

Welcome to Twinkler, the online radio-network planning tool.

Go to [Quick Start](/getting-started.md?id=quick-start) to jump straight in and create your first coverage prediction in under a minute.

For background information see [Getting Started](/getting-started.md), which has an overview of the [key concepts](/getting-started.md?id=key-concepts) in Twinkler and how to navigate using [shortcuts](/getting-started.md?id=shortcuts).

See [common tasks](/tasks.md) to learn how to do normal actions like adding a site with coverage or selecting an antenna.

Details about the options in all menus is available in [Views](/views.md) and [Map Menus](map-menus.md)

To find out about extra features see [tools](/tools.md) and [settings](/settings.md).

We would also love to receive your [feedback](/tools.md?id=feedback). Additional information and help is always available at [twinkler.app](https://twinkler.app/).
